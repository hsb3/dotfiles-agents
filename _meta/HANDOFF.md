# HANDOFF — dotfiles-agents

*Cold-start bridge. Secret-free (secrets live in `_meta/operations/`, never tracked). Not a journal — shipped work lives in git/PR history; this holds current state, in-flight work, decisions, and the gotchas that bite.*

## 0 · Orientation

Source of truth for **proven** coding-agent extenders (created 2026-06-26; built from scratch — NOT a rename of `hsb3-custom-plugins`, which stays frozen as the migration source). Siblings: `dotfiles` (tooling), `dotfiles-agents-workbench` (the unproven bench — promotes one-way INTO here), `dotfiles-bootstrap` (deploy/orchestrator). Governance on the strategy desk (`~/Documents/Claude/Projects/dotfiles-agents-cowork/`): `_structure/{CANON.md, repository-technical-plan.md}` is the design constitution; `analyses/` is historical. The promotion gate + lifecycle live in `dotfiles-agents-workbench/docs/`. **Planning desk** at `_meta/plans/` — run the `planning-desk` skill; `_config.md` has the gate menu.

## 1 · Current state

- **Translation service is feature-complete** across all four primitive types (skills · agents · CMA payloads · mcp) plus internal + externals-mcp inputs: `scripts/translate.py` renders `primitives-core/` + `externals.yaml` → `targets/{claude-code,opencode,claude-agents}/` + a content-hash lock. **Roster/build/test counts are live — run `make ci`** (5 lanes: `check` roster↔disk · `validate` primitive content · `names` id grammar · `build-check` targets drift · `test`). Green on main.
- **Roster schema:** `origin: authored|sourced` (internal is dead), required `disposition:`, optional `requires:` capability flags, sourced ⇒ `upstream`+`ref` guard-enforced.
- **Promotion gate RATIFIED** (CANON 12; J1 = ≥2 real uses). **Branch protection** live: required check is the `make ci` aggregate; force-push/deletion blocked; admin bypass retained — agents PR.

## 2 · In flight / next up

- **Gate-2 pilot on raptorgpt-agents** (`~/Developer/RAPTOR/WEB_APPS/raptor_gpt/raptorgpt-agents`): audit → manifest → scaffold → re-audit, driving the four project-workflow standards skills (repo-meta-structure, memory-taxonomy, repo-compliance-audit, mise-en-place-scaffold).
- **Disposition sweep (Q-13/T-20):** roster entries are `disposition: untriaged` pending classification to `qualified | grandfathered-pending-use | demoted`.
- **#36 — clone-at-build externals** *(the last unbuilt capability):* `externals.yaml` tracks ~30 third-party skills/plugins with `upstream: null`; only `kind: mcp` renders today. Research each upstream, pin a ref, then implement the clone-into-`targets/` step in `translate.py` (CANON 11).
- **#24 — loadability smoke** (`make smoke`, opt-in, NOT required CI): drive the real tools against generated bundles (`opencode debug …`; `claude --mcp-config`/`--plugin-dir` + `plugin details`; CMA payloads vs pinned OpenAPI); skip-on-absent.
- **#25 — chore:** close file handles in `translate.py`, then drop `-W ignore::ResourceWarning` from `make test`.
- **Promoting a parked item** (CANON 12) needs ≥2 cited real uses + H1–H5; `opencode-expert` is the strongest candidate.

## 3 · Conventions & gotchas

- **Never hand-edit generated `targets/` or the results lock** — they're drift-guarded. Edit `primitives-core/` then `make build`.
- **Tests are stdlib `unittest` only** — keep `make ci` zero-install (no pytest/uv in the required lane). **Fixtures live under `tests/` temp dirs, never `primitives-core/`** — `check_roster.py` flags on-disk orphans. Drift guards prove *consistency*; the tests + `validate_primitives.py` prove *correctness*.
- **SKILL.md `description` must not contain XML/angle-bracket tags** — Claude Cowork refuses to load such skills. Skill-specific: agent `.md` descriptions may use `<example>`. Enforced by `validate_primitives.py`.
- **Naming grammar is shared with the workbench:** `tests/test_check_naming.py` imports the sibling `../dotfiles-agents-workbench/scripts/promote_check.py` constants and asserts no drift — but it **silently skips when the sibling checkout is absent**. Keep the two repos side-by-side to run it; don't rename the grammar constants on either side.
- **Board scripts are authoritative HERE** (`primitives-core/skills/github-project-board/scripts/`) — deliberately diverged from frozen hsb3-custom-plugins; never re-copy from the frozen repo.
- **Archived plans:** `_meta/_archive/<issue>-<slug>.md` (tracked via gitignore negation). On close, `git mv` the `plan.md` there and move its README row ACTIVE→ARCHIVED so `reconcile.py` stays clean. Run `_meta/plans/_utils/` scripts from the **main tree** (they read live `gh` + disk); ACTIVE README rows use the **bare slug**, not a markdown link.
- **`gh` token gotcha:** env `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't resolve project-board owner — use `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh …` for `gh project` / `gh repo create`.
- **Conflicting PRs get NO CI:** GitHub skips `pull_request` workflows when the merge ref won't build — "no checks reported" means rebase onto main first, not that CI failed.
- **Deploy targets (verified, opencode 1.16.2):** opencode agents → `.opencode/agent(s)/` or `~/.config/opencode/agent(s)/`; opencode skills auto-scanned from `~/.claude/skills/` + `~/.agents/skills/` (config loaded once — restart opencode to pick up new skills). CC marketplace = two generated catalogs: `claude plugin marketplace add hsb3/dotfiles-agents` reads the repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; a local-path add of `targets/claude-code` reads that dir's own marketplace.json (what `dotfiles-bootstrap` uses). Both drift-guarded in `make ci`.
- `bgIsolation:none` in `.claude/settings.json` — this repo isn't parallel-mutated; background agents share the main tree.
- Trunk-based, remote is SSH: branch `<type>/<name>`, squash-merge, commits end with the `Claude-Session:` footer; agents PR (don't push main).
