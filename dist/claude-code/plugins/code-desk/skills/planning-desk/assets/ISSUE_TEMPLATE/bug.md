## What's wrong

The observed behavior vs the expected behavior, grounded in source (`path:line`) or a repro.

## Repro

Steps / inputs that trigger it; the environment if it matters.

## Acceptance criteria

How we know it's fixed — independently verifiable (a regression test that fails before and passes
after; the bad output no longer occurs).
